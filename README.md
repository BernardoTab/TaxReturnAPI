# Tax Return API

## Description
This project is part of GlobalBlue's interview process. The idea is to allow the user to input an amount value with a VAT rate and be given the remaining computed values.

You can input one of the following values:
- **Net Value**: The price before VAT is added.
- **Gross Value**: The price after VAT has been applied.
- **VAT Value**: The amount of VAT added to the Net Value.

You also provide the Austrian VAT rate, which can be 10%, 13%, or 20%.
